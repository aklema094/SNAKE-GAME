Snake Game  
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game implemented using Java, leveraging the Swing and AWT libraries for the graphical user interface. The objective of the game is to control a snake as it navigates the screen, eating food to grow in size while avoiding collisions with itself and the screen boundaries.  

Features:  
1. Simple Gameplay Mechanics:  
   - Control the snake using keyboard arrow keys.  
   - The snake grows in size each time it eats food.  

2. Dynamic Gameplay:  
   - Randomly placed food items keep the gameplay engaging.  
   - The game increases in difficulty as the snake grows longer.  

3. Interactive Interface:  
   - Built using Java Swing for smooth animations and responsiveness.  
   - Styled with AWT for a clean and minimalistic design.  

4. Game Over Conditions:  
   - Collision with the screen boundaries or the snake's body ends the game.  
   - Displays the player's final score at the end.  

This project is an excellent example of combining object-oriented programming with GUI development in Java. It serves as a fun and educational experience for those learning game development and graphical interfaces.
